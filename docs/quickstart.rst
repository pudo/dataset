Quickstart
==========


Hi, welcome to the twelve-minute quick-start tutorial.

Connecting to a database
------------------------

At first you need to import the dataset package :) ::

   import dataset

To connect to a database you need to identify it by its `URL <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/engines.html#engine-creation-api>`_, which basically is a string of the form ``"dialect://user:password@host/dbname"``. Here are a few examples for different database backends::

   # connecting to a SQLite database
   db = dataset.connect('sqlite:///mydatabase.db')

   # connecting to a MySQL database with user and password
   db = dataset.connect('mysql://user:password@localhost/mydatabase')

   # connecting to a PostgreSQL database
   db = dataset.connect('postgresql://scott:tiger@localhost:5432/mydatabase')

It is also possible to define the `URL` as an environment variable called `DATABASE_URL`
so you can initialize database connection without explicitly passing an `URL`::

   db = dataset.connect()

Depending on which database you're using, you may also have to install
the database bindings to support that database. SQLite is included in
the Python core, but PostgreSQL requires ``psycopg2`` to be installed. 
MySQL can be enabled by installing the ``mysql-db`` drivers. 


Storing data
------------

To store some data you need to get a reference to a table. You don't need
to worry about whether the table already exists or not, since dataset
will create it automatically::

   # get a reference to the table 'person'
   table = db['person']

Now storing data in a table is a matter of a single function call. Just
pass a `dict`_ to *insert*. Note that you don't need to create the columns
*name* and *age* â€“ dataset will do this automatically::

   # Insert a new record.
   table.insert(dict(name='John Doe', age=46))

   # dataset will create "missing" columns any time you insert a dict with an unknown key
   table.insert(dict(name='Jane Doe', age=37, gender='female'))

.. _dict: http://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#dict

Updating existing entries is easy, too::

   table.update(dict(name='John Doe', age=47), ['name'])

The list of filter columns given as the second argument filter using the
values in the first column. If you don't want to update over a
particular value, just use the auto-generated ``id`` column.

Inspecting databases and tables
-------------------------------

When dealing with unknown databases we might want to check their structure
first. To start exploring, let's find out what tables are stored in the
database:

   >>> print db.tables
   set([u'user', u'action'])

Now, let's list all columns available in the table ``user``:

   >>> print db['user'].columns
   set([u'id', u'name', u'email', u'pwd', u'country'])

Using ``len()`` we can get the total number of rows in a table:

   >>> print len(db['user'])
   187

Reading data from tables
------------------------

Now let's get some real data out of the table::

   users = db['user'].all()

If we simply want to iterate over all rows in a table, we can omit :py:meth:`all() <dataset.Table.all>`::

   for user in db['user']:
      print user['email']

We can search for specific entries using :py:meth:`find() <dataset.Table.find>` and
:py:meth:`find_one() <dataset.Table.find_one>`::

   # All users from China
   users = table.find(country='China')

   # Get a specific user
   john = table.find_one(name='John Doe')

Using  :py:meth:`distinct() <dataset.Table.distinct>` we can grab a set of rows
with unique values in one or more columns::

   # Get one user per country
   db['user'].distinct('country')


Running custom SQL queries
--------------------------

Of course the main reason you're using a database is that you want to
use the full power of SQL queries. Here's how you run them with ``dataset``::

   result = db.query('SELECT country, COUNT(*) c FROM user GROUP BY country')
   for row in result:
      print row['country'], row['c']

The :py:meth:`query() <dataset.Table.query>` method can also be used to 
access the underlying `SQLAlchemy core API <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/ru/latest/orm/query.html#the-query-object>`_, which allows for the
programmatic construction of more complex queries::

   table = db['users'].table
   statement = table.select(table.c.name.like('%Snoopy%'))
   result = db.query(statement) 


Exporting data
--------------

While playing around with our database in Python is a nice thing, they are 
sometimes just a processing stage until we go on to use it in another
place, say in an interactive web application. To make this seamless,
``dataset`` supports serializing rows of data into static JSON and CSV files
such using the :py:meth:`freeze() <dataset.freeze>` function::

   # export all users into a single JSON
   result = db['users'].all()
   dataset.freeze(result, 'users.json', format='json')

You can create one file per row by setting ``mode`` to "item"::

   # export one JSON file per user
   dataset.freeze(result, 'users/{{ id }}.json', format='json', mode='item')

Since this is a common operation we made it available via command line
utility ``datafreeze``. Read more about the :doc:`freezefile markup <freezefile>`.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ datafreeze freezefile.yaml
